Take a key with a lot of subkeys or values
count them
enumerate all of them orderly, starting from 0
sum an identifying fixed property (e.g. MAC)
calculte remainder of sum/count
access the subkey/value in that calculated index
this is the starting block


storage format is chained blocks, each in another location
each block has STLPV format
	BID:		block ID
	Type:		{descriptor, data, end}
	Length:		length of value
	Pointer:	([random int/count=next block index], next BID = 1)
	Value:		data bytes
